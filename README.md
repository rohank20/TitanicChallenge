# TitanicChallenge
This is my first project uploaded on GitHub. The purpose of this project is to predict if a passenger onboard the Titanic survived/didn't survive. I have used some feature engineering to select features and then SimpleImputer for data preprocessing. I have then used a Random Forest Classifier model for this task.
